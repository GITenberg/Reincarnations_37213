THE GANG<BR>
</H3>

<P CLASS="poem">
Our fathers must have sinned: we pay for it!<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Through them the base-born tribe that sold their king<BR>
Sneaked into power, and in high places sit,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And do their will and wish in everything;<BR>
For they may rob and kill, grieve and disgrace<BR>
All who are left alive of Eiver's race.<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
They seized with daring guile on rank and pelf,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And swore that they would never bend a knee<BR>
Unto the king: they robbed the Church herself:<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They stole our princes' lands, and o'er the sea<BR>
They packed those princes, or drove them away<BR>
To barren rocks and fields that have no clay.<BR>

<P CLASS="poem">
That spawn of base mechanics! who could ne'er,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Though Doomsday came, by any art be made<BR>
Noble, are noble now, and have no care:<BR>

In stately places, proud as if the mud<BR>
And slime that swills their veins were princes' blood.<BR>

Let us be wise and wary of that gang!<BR>

For, be things wry and crooked and to guess,<BR>
Those twisters are at home in twistiness.<BR>

Could slip with more address from harm than they<BR>
Can slip from punishment and get away.<BR>

When trouble came it was their plan to get<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our friends into the boat they meant to leave,<BR>
And there was some one left to pay their debt,<BR>

NOTE
</H3>

<P>
This book ought to be called Loot or Plunder or Pieces of Eight or
Treasure-Trove, or some name which would indicate and get away from its
source, for although everything in it can be referred to the Irish of
from one hundred to three hundred years ago the word translation would
be a misdescription.  There are really only two translations in it,
Keating's "O Woman full of Wiliness" and Raftery's "County Mayo."  Some
of the poems owe no more than a phrase, a line, half a line, to the
Irish, and around these scraps I have blown a bubble of verse and made
my poem.  In other cases, where the matter of the poem is almost
entirely taken from the Irish, I have yet followed my own instinct in
the arrangement of it, and the result might be called new poems.  My
first idea was to make an anthology of people whom long ago our poets
had praised, so that, in another language and another time, these
honoured names might be heard again, even though in my own terms and
not in the historic context.  I did not pursue this course, for I could
not control the material which came to me and which took no heed of my
plan and was just as interesting.  It would therefore be a mistake to
consider that these verses are representative of the poets by whom they
are inspired.  In the case of David O'Bruadair this is less true than
in any of the others, but, even in his case, although I have often
conveyed his matter almost verbatim, the selection is not
representative of the poet.  One side only, and that the least, is
shown, for a greater pen than mine would be necessary if that tornado
of rage, eloquence, and humour were to be presented; but the poems
which I give might almost be taken as translations of one side of his
terrific muse.
</P>

<P>
As regards Egan O'Rahilly a similar remark is necessary.  No pen and no
language but his own could even distantly indicate a skill and melody
which might be spoken of as one of the wonders of the world.  I have
done exactly as I pleased with his material.
</P>

<P>
From Antoine O'Raftery I have taken more than from any of the others,
and have in nearly every instance treated his matter so familiarly that
a lover of Raftery (and who, having read a verse of his, does not love
him?) might not know I was indebted to this poet for my songs.  His
work is different from that of Keating, O'Rahilly, or O'Bruadair, for
these were learned men, and were writing out of a tradition so hoary
with age and so complicated in convention that only learned and subtle
minds could attempt it.  I have wondered would Keating or O'Rahilly
have been very scornful of Raftery's work?  I think they might have
been angry at such an ignorance of all the rules, and would probably
have torn the paper on which his poems were written, and sat down to
compose a satire which would have raised blisters on that poor, blind,
wandering singer, the master of them all.
</P>

<P>
In two of the poems which I tried to translate from Raftery I have
completely failed.  Against one of them I broke an hundred pens in
vain; and in the other, "The County Mayo," I have been so close to
success and so far from succeeding that I may mourn a little about it.
The first three verses are not bad, but the last verse is the
completest miss: the simplicity of the original is there, its music is
not, and in the last two lines the poignance, which should come on the
reader as though a hand gripped at his heart, is absent.  The other
failure I have not printed because I could get no way on it at all: it
would not even begin to translate.  This is Raftery's reply to the man
who did not recognise him as he fiddled to a crowd, and asked "who is
the musician?"
</P>

</P>

<P>
Dissimilar as these poets are from each other in time, education, and
temperament, they are alike in that they were all poor men, so poor
that there was often little difference between them and beggars.  They
all sing of their poverty: Keating as a fact to be recorded among other
facts, O'Rahilly in a very stately and bitter complaint, and Raftery as
in the quotation above; but O'Bruadair lets out of him an unending,
rebellious bawl which would be the most desolating utterance ever made
by man if it was not also the most gleeful.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works

individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE

defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
